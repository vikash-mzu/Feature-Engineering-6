    "Q1: Pearson Correlation Coefficient for Study Time and Exam Scores\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. The formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient (rrr) is:\n",
    "r=∑(Xi−Xˉ)(Yi−Yˉ)∑(Xi−Xˉ)2∑(Yi−Yˉ)2r = \\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\sum (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}}r=∑(Xi−Xˉ)2∑(Yi−Yˉ)2∑(Xi−Xˉ)(Yi−Yˉ)\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "•\tXiX_iXi is the value of the first variable (e.g., study time),\n",
    "•\tYiY_iYi is the value of the second variable (e.g., exam scores),\n",
    "•\tXˉ\\bar{X}Xˉ and Yˉ\\bar{Y}Yˉ are the means of XXX and YYY.\n",
    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, you would need the data for study time and exam scores. Once you have the value of rrr, the interpretation is as follows:\n",
    "•\tr=1r = 1r=1: Perfect positive linear relationship\n",
    "•\tr=−1r = -1r=−1: Perfect negative linear relationship\n",
    "•\tr=0r = 0r=0: No linear relationship\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "•\tA positive correlation (e.g., r=0.7r = 0.7r=0.7) would suggest that as study time increases, exam scores tend to increase.\n",
    "•\tA negative correlation (e.g., r=−0.5r = -0.5r=−0.5) would suggest that as study time increases, exam scores tend to decrease.\n",

    "Q2: Spearman's Rank Correlation for Sleep and Job Satisfaction\n",
    "Spearman's rank correlation measures the strength of the monotonic relationship between two ranked variables. It is calculated based on the ranked values of the variables and is useful when the relationship is non-linear but monotonic. The formula for Spearman's rank correlation (ρ\\rhoρ) is:\n",
    "ρ=1−6∑di2n(n2−1)\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}ρ=1−n(n2−1)6∑di2\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "•\tdid_idi is the difference between the ranks of corresponding variables,\n",
    "•\tnnn is the number of observations.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "•\tρ=1\\rho = 1ρ=1: Perfect positive monotonic relationship\n",
    "•\tρ=−1\\rho = -1ρ=−1: Perfect negative monotonic relationship\n",
    "•\tρ=0\\rho = 0ρ=0: No monotonic relationship\n",
    "Example: If ρ=0.8\\rho = 0.8ρ=0.8 for sleep and job satisfaction, it indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship: as sleep increases, job satisfaction tends to increase in a consistent manner. If ρ=−0.3\\rho = -0.3ρ=−0.3, it indicates a weak negative monotonic relationship: as sleep increases, job satisfaction tends to decrease, but not in a linear manner.\n",

    "Q3: Comparing Pearson and Spearman Correlations for Exercise and BMI\n",
    "Suppose you have collected data on hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) for 50 participants. The Pearson correlation will measure the linear relationship between the two variables, while the Spearman correlation will measure the monotonic relationship.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1.\tCalculate Pearson correlation using the Pearson formula, which captures the linearity of the relationship.\n",
    "2.\tCalculate Spearman's rank correlation to assess whether a monotonic (but possibly non-linear) relationship exists.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "•\tIf the Pearson correlation is close to 0 and the Spearman correlation is significant (e.g., ρ=0.6\\rho = 0.6ρ=0.6), it suggests that while there is no linear relationship, there may be a monotonic relationship.\n",
    "•\tIf both correlations are similar (e.g., Pearson r=−0.7r = -0.7r=−0.7 and Spearman ρ=−0.75\\rho = -0.75ρ=−0.75), it suggests both linear and monotonic relationships exist between exercise and BMI.\n",

    "Q4: Pearson Correlation for TV Time and Physical Activity\n",
    "To examine the relationship between TV time (hours per day) and physical activity (measured on some scale), the Pearson correlation coefficient can be calculated using the formula for rrr.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1.\tCollect data on TV time and physical activity for 50 participants.\n",
    "2.\tApply the Pearson formula to the data.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "•\tIf r=−0.85r = -0.85r=−0.85, this would suggest a strong negative linear relationship, meaning that as TV time increases, physical activity tends to decrease significantly.\n",
    "•\tIf r=0.1r = 0.1r=0.1, it would suggest a very weak or negligible linear relationship between TV time and physical activity.\n",
    "For Q5:\n",
    "You need to encode the soft drink preference (categorical variable) and calculate the correlation between Age and Preference using appropriate methods, as correlation is generally calculated for numerical data. One potential way to proceed with this task is:\n",
    "1.\tAssign numerical values to each brand of soft drink (e.g., Coke = 1, Pepsi = 2, Mountain Dew = 3).\n",
    "2.\tPerform a statistical analysis to determine the relationship between Age and Soft Drink Preference.\n",
    "For Q6:\n",
    "1.\tThe Pearson correlation coefficient will be calculated between Number of Sales Calls per Day and Number of Sales per Week for a sample of 30 sales representatives.\n",
    "2.\tYou would use Python's scipy.stats.pearsonr or pandas.corr to calculate the correlation coefficient.\n",
